# BetterShift.vim
Ever been frustrated that `5>>` indents 5 lines 1 time instead of 1 line 5 times? Or that `2>7j` indents 14 lines?

Well this plugin overwrites the default shift operation and handles `[count]` and `{motion}` in an intuitive way.

## Installation
### Using vim-plug
```vim
Plug 'Kirens/BetterShift.vim'
```

### Using packer
```lua
use 'Kirens/BetterShift.vim'
```

## TODO
Note: This is a very crude plugin in it's early stages.

* Suport custom user keymaps
* Some simple documentation
